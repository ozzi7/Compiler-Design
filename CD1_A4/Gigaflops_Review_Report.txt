In the review hours it was noted that the generated assembly code leads to segmentation faults.
The reason being a mistake in methodDecl where the prologue is emitted. The instructions:

enter $8, $0 and

pushl %ebp
movl %esp, %ebp
subl %esp, 10

are in fact identical, so only one of them is needed. When the final return instruction gets called
the wrong return address is loaded.

Additionally, the main function does not return 0. Adding

movl $0, %eax

before calling leave and return will solve this problem.
